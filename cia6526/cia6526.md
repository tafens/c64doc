# MOS 6526 CIA

## Timers

The 6526 has two timers, timer A and timer B. The timers count down from a set 16-bit value down to zero and can either stop there or restart from the same value. Each time a timer reaches zero, an underflow condition occurs that sets that timer's flag in the interrupt register, and if the interrupt mask register also has that timer’s flag set, an interrupt is generated.

### Ticks

Each timer has a tick source. For timer A the source can be one of phi2 clock, or positive CNT pin transitions. For timer B the source can be one of phi2 clock, positive CNT pin transitions, timer A underflows, or timer A underflows while CNT pin is high.

The timer is always ticked in unison with the phi2 clock. In phi2 mode, the timer is always ticked with each phi2 clock as the tick source generates one tick each clock cycle. In CNT mode however, the tick source only generates a tick if the CNT pin has transitioned from low to high some time during the previous clock cycle.

### Latency and stall

Two clock cycles after the bit 0 (”running”) in the timer's control register has been set, the timer starts counting down from its current value back to zero. When it has reached zero it is reloaded from the latch as soon as another tick is inbound. The reload stalls the timer for one additional cycle, and any tick incoming during that time is ignored.

In phi2 mode there is always another tick inbound, so a zero value will never be seen, and the latch value will be seen for two consecutive clocks before the count down is commenced.
